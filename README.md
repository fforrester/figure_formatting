# figure_formatting

An installable Python package intended to make it easier to produce near-publication-quality figures that ~~are~~ were broadly consistent with the Morgan group style guide.

Colour pallets are given in the examples directory.

**A Note on Colour:** 
- Colours are based on the Masataka Okabe and Kei Ito accessible palette.
- Gradated palettes use the above as a base (where possible) and vary the shade in both directions (0 = lightest & 9 = darkest). Additional colours have been provided that may be of use.
- All palettes are colour-blind friendly in isolation; however, care should be taken when mixing. That being said, it is best practice to design figures that do not rely solely on colour. This not only ensures accessibility for individuals with colour vision deficiencies but also improves readability in various conditions, such as black-and-white printing or low-contrast display.

**A Note on Size and Proportion**
- Golden ratio 1:1.618
- In most cases, figures should be designed to fit a single column (8.3 cm or 3.15 in) or double column (17.1 cm or 6.73 in) width but must be no larger than 23.3cm.
