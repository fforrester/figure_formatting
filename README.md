# figure_formatting

An installable Python package intended to make it easier to produce near-publication-quality figures that ~~are~~ were broadly consistent with the Morgan group style guide.

Colour pallets are given in the examples directory.

**A Note on Colour:** 
- Colours are based on the Masataka Okabe and Kei Ito accessible palette, with gradated palettes using these as a base.
- All palettes are colour-blind friendly in isolation; however, care should be taken when mixing. That being said, it is best practice to design figures in such a way that they do not rely solely on colour. This not only ensures accessibility for individuals with colour vision deficiencies but improves readability in various conditions, such as black-and-white printing or low-contrast display.

**A Note on Size and Proportion**
- Golden ratio 1:1.618
- In most cases, figures should be designed to fit a single column (8.3 cm or 3.15 in) or double column (17.1 cm or 6.73 in) width but must be no larger than 23.3cm.
