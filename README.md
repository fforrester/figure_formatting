# figure_formatting

An installable Python package intended to make it easier to produce near-publication-quality figures that ~~are~~ were broadly consistent with the Morgan group style guide.

Colour pallets are given in the examples directory.

**Important Note:** Sequential palettes are all created to be colour-blind friendly; however, care should be taken when using the "standard" palette, as these may not be. It is a best practice to design graphics in such a way that they do not rely solely on colour. This ensures accessibility for individuals with colour vision deficiencies and improves readability in various conditions, such as black-and-white printing or low-contrast display.

Clone the repo and install:
```
git clone https://github.com/fforrester/figure_formatting.git
